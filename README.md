# Interactive-Article
Iâ€™ve created an interactive article explaining what cyberbullying is and how it's affecting The Netherlands. The user can interact with the data to show different aspects of the used datasets. The data itself will also be changing throughout the article so it shows datavisualisations of the chapters you're reading at that moment.
